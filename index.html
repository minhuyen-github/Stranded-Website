                    <p>First week - Brainstorming time! </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each member propose their own game idea, and vote for their favorite one. The most voted idea will be used.</li>
                        <li>We discuss about the game environment, the art styles, the player movement, and the implementation of the puzzles.</li>
                        <li>Writing and editing the game design document to demonstrate our ideas.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Second week - Prototyping</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Player movement and animation</li>
                        <li>Pushing boxes mechanics</li>
                        <li>Auto-generating puzzles for each level</li>
                        <li>Archieving the time machine pieces</li>
                        <li>Displaying the archived pieces</li>

                        <li>We have developed an algorithm to create random puzzles from scratch. However, it causes a very long loading time. Thus, we decided to use existed puzzles in the form of .txt file, then randomly select a puzzle to generate our levels.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Fourth week - Alpha Play Testing</p>

                        <li>We have also added more components: a health bar, a main menu, a pause menu, and a reset button.</li>
                        <li>If the player gets hurt, the character will flash three times.</li>
                    </ul>
